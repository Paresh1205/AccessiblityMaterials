HTML&Accessiblity

HTML5 markups play imp role in accessiblity.
easies to develop when we use html5 semantics.
SEO(search engine optimisation)

Use of semantics in accessiblity:
	-Avoid using font instead use <h>tag
	-Avoid using br tag instead use p tag
	-If list is required use ordered list or unordered list don't use br tag continuously to create list
	

Page Layouts:->
	-Whenever u are creating payge layout don't use table to create the page layout.
	-Follow basic html5 semantic tags
	
Using Clear Languages:->
	
	-OffScreen text-Read more button that hides text when u click on it you will see the further information.
	-Top-left to bottom right the reading of web page is done.
	-focus is only on intercactive elements(e.g-buttons and all the interactive elements hyperlinks)
	
How browser knows which is first second hyperlinks:-	
	-Off screen text come into picture.i.e description of hyperlink(focus)
	-href=# or href="javascript:void(0) when no hyperlink is there.
	-<span> class name is a11y and give the description in style tag as .a11y{ } this will hide the text behind hyperlink
	-be sure about spellings write januay instead of jan.\

Importance of HTML 5

=>UI controls-
web parts of html that user interacts with.
e.g buttons,links,textbox,checkbox,radio btn.

label ur form controls with label tag.
meaningfull text labels->labels which give useful  information

=>building keyboard accessiblity
tab index 0 and tab index -1
	tabindex='0'->it will not initialize any tab value.
	tabindex='-1'->hide the focus from keyboard.
	
To focus element using .focus() make sure u use tabindex='0'
e.g $('h1').attr('tabindex','0').focus();

=>meaningful text labels
	labels which give useful  information

=>text alternatives
 for img use alt text.
 describe the purpose of images same goes for images and videos.
 for images- alt to give info about images
 for videos- CC(closed captions) in youtube so disabled can go through subtitles.
 for audios-transcript text

=>Empty alt Attributes:
 images that are use for decoration purpose and keep alt as empty.

 longdesc:pass .html file

 instead of giving longdesc we ca use <figure> tag.
 inside fig tag you can use <img> tag and <figurecaption> tag.
 
 in hyperlink target="_blank" this will open new window.
 advance warning text for external links

 skip links->Skip to main content.

 Accessible data table:
 1)Caption text in table-describe the purpose of table. just after table tag <caption></caption>
 2)Heading: using <th> tag
 3)connect each column with header.
 	scope attributes: if scope="col" it means whole column and if scope="row" it means whole row is considered.
